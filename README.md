# My React Blog

This is a blog built with React and Vite.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser

## Project Structure
The project has a header component which shows a header of My Awesome Blog with a home and about link.
This relies on the index.css file for stylin, which includes a toggle if the user currently has their browser in dark mode.

Then in the app.jsx file there is a main component that says Welcome to my blog! and This is my first React component.
It also takes in the Header component as a prop and displays it.
This relies on the app.css file for styling.

The main.jsx file is the entry point of the application and renders the App component.
## What I Learned
I learned how to get a screenshot to display in the README.md file.
I learned how to get dark mode to work in the header component.

## Styling Approach
I chose the css module styling because it makes the styling more organized and easier to manage.

## New Features
I added the BlogPost component which displays a single blog post.
I added the BlogList component which displays a list of blog posts.
I added the posts.js file which con tains an array of sets of blog posts.
